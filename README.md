Common Lisp : A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation. David Touretzky (Carnegie Mellon University): Benjamin/Cummings Piublishing Company, Redwood City, Calif., 1990.
(PDF of book from: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf)

Using this ANSI Common Lisp implementation:

CLISP
(link: https://clisp.sourceforge.io/)

NOTE - Would prefer SBCL but that implementation has lousy terminal REPL.

Using Eclipse with Dandelion plugin (but using terminal window to actually run SBLC) on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.

Using Atom with Lisp plugin on MacBook Pro.
Using Eclipse with Dandelion plugin on Ubuntu machine (still using CLISP in terminal)

USE
1. use "clisp" at terminal to access REPL
2. use "(load 'filename.lisp')" in clisp
