Common Lisp : A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation. David Touretzky (Carnegie Mellon University): Benjamin/Cummings Piublishing Company, Redwood City, Calif., 1990.
(PDF of book from: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/book.pdf)

Using this ANSI Common Lisp implementation:

CLISP
(link: https://clisp.sourceforge.io/)

NOTE - Would prefer SBCL but that implementation has lousy terminal REPL.

Using Atom with Lisp plugin (across Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu machines)

USE
1. use "clisp" at terminal to access REPL
2. use "(load 'filename.lisp')" in clisp

Personal study of Lisp. Only used language for 1 semester while studying for BSCS.
